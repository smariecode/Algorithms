Reverse the provided string.
You may need to turn the string into an array before you can reverse it.
Your result must be a string.


This solution does not use any object classes


  var myString = '';
  for (var i = str.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) // decrement until string ends
    myString += str[i];
  return myString;
}
