Check if a string (first argument, str) ends with the given target string (second argument, target).
This challenge can be solved with the .endsWith() method, which was introduced in ES2015. But for the purpose of this challenge, we would like you to use one of the JavaScript substring methods instead.
Remember to use Read-Search-Ask if you get stuck. Write your own code.
Here are some helpful links:
String.prototype.substr()
String.prototype.substring()

Given data:

confirmEnding("Bastian", "n") should return true.
confirmEnding("Connor", "n") should return false.
confirmEnding("Walking on water and developing software from a specification are easy if both are frozen", "specification") should return false.
confirmEnding("He has to give me a new name", "name") should return true.
confirmEnding("Open sesame", "same") should return true.
confirmEnding("Open sesame", "pen") should return false.
confirmEnding("If you want to save our world, you must hurry. We dont know how much longer we can withstand the nothing", "mountain") should return false.


I was not sure what the difference was between substr and substring, so I did some research:
Basic answer: 

substring(x, index to stop at but not include)
substr(x, max length to return)

I really just needed to get the nth characters end of the first string passed. I got this from calculating the length of 
'target' and then applying it's negative to substr(). Easy stuff!

function confirmEnding(str, target) {

var tarLength = target.length;
var strEnd = str.substr(-tarLength); 

  if(strEnd === target){
    return true;
  }
  else {
    return false;
  }
}

I looked at other possible answers and found these:
// from Rafase282 - this is more simplified than mine, (I like his better!)

function end(str, target) {
  return (str.substr(-target.length) === target);
}

And here is another solution,
// from Jack's blog
function end(str, target) {
  var targetLength = target.length;
  if (str.slice(-targetLength) === target) {
  return true; } else { return false; }
  return str;
}
end("Bastian", "n");

Interesting how we all think differently !
