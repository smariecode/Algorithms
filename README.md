# FreeCodeCampJournal
Daily Journal for FreeCodeCamp Projects

Hello!

I have finally gotten through all of the pre-algorithm exercises in Free Code Camp. Now I will be doing some fun and challenging work, (the algorithm section), and I wanted to create this journal to keep track of all the neat stuff I will be learning.

Each project I finish will be left 'as is' and will be preserved. I will not be updating these projects as languages evolve. This is not to be used as anyone's cheat sheet, PLEASE do not review my work unless you want SPOILERS, thank you.

For each project I will explain it's purpose and then write the code to solve that particular challenge. In many cases I will document alternative solutions. 

Please feel free to contact me for any reason, 

Nice to meet you and have fun browsing my work!
