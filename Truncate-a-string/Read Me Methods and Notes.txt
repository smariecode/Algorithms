Truncate a string (first argument) if it is longer than the given maximum string length (second argument). Return the truncated string with a ... ending.
Note that inserting the three dots to the end will add to the string length.
However, if the given maximum string length num is less than or equal to 3, then the addition of the three dots does not add to the string length in determining the truncated string.
Remember to use Read-Search-Ask if you get stuck. Write your own code.
Here are some helpful links:
String.prototype.slice()  

Given data:
truncateString("A-tisket a-tasket A green and yellow basket", 11) should return "A-tisket...".
truncateString("Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers", 14) should return "Peter Piper...".
truncateString("A-tisket a-tasket A green and yellow basket", "A-tisket a-tasket A green and yellow basket".length) should return "A-tisket a-tasket A green and yellow basket".
truncateString("A-tisket a-tasket A green and yellow basket", "A-tisket a-tasket A green and yellow basket".length + 2) should return "A-tisket a-tasket A green and yellow basket".
truncateString("A-", 1) should return "A...".
truncateString("Absolutely Longer", 2) should return "Ab...".   

There are basically 3 cases here:
1) if string is longer than given max length AND max length is greater than or = to 3
2) if string is less than or equal to given length
3) if max length is less than 3



function truncateString(str, num) {
  
  var length = str.length;
  
   if(length > num && num >= 3){ //if string is longer than given max length AND greater than or = to 3
     str = str.slice(0, num - 3); //to make space for the ...
     str += ("...");
   }
  else if(length <= num){ //if string is less than or equal to given length
     str = str.slice(0, num);
   }
  else { //if max length is less than 3
     str = str.slice(0, num);
     str += ("...");
  }
  return str;
}

After completing this and looking at other methods, I see I could have done this a bit differently by combining
these if statements like this:

1) if string is longer than given max length AND max length is greater than or = to 3
2) if string is less than or equal to given length
3) if max length is less than 3

    var modStr = '';
    if (str.length > num) { //combined 1 and 2 from above
        modStr = str.slice(0,num-3) + '...';
        return modStr;
    }
    return str;
}
