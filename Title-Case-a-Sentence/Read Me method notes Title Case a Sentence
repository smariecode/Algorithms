Return the provided string with the first letter of each word capitalized. Make sure the rest of the word is in lower case.
For the purpose of this exercise, you should also capitalize connecting words like "the" and "of".

String.prototype.split()

I actually did this in under 10 minutes! I used a while loop. 

My steps:
Convert the string to lowercase and then split it into substrings.
Declare variable i to be used in while loop.
Capitalized the first substring (because it just will be EVERY time.
While i is less than the string length,
Check to see if substring is a space.
If it is a space, increment i (to get to the next character) and then convert that next character to uppercase.
Else, increment i and go through while loop again if not end.  
Once all substring chars have been fed through while loop, join the substrings and return that value. 

function titleCase(str) {
  
  str = str.toLowerCase().split(''); // convert string to lowercase then split into substrings
  var i = 0; //for incrementing while loop
  str[0] = str[0].toUpperCase(); //capitalize the first letter in the substring
  
  while(i < str.length) { // iterate through substrings until end of substrings
    if(str[i] === ' ') { //if current substring equals a space
      i++; //increment to get to next substring
      str[i] = str[i].toUpperCase(); //replace current substring with capital letter
    }
    else {
      i++; //if substring is not a space increment and continue at the beginning of while loop
    }
  }
  
  return str.join('');
}

Thoughts - Are there more efficient ways? More creative ways?
